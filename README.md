## Summary of the article

first of all, don't stack yourself in tutorials try to focus on crash courses at first to get familiar with the new tech then try to build a simple project by yourself even if you do the same project more than once with different tech it doesn't matter because the goal here to learn the tech and handle it then you can go to the bigger courses and a complex projects.
